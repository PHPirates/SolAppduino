	\section{Setup of the project}
		\subsection{Hardware used}
			We used an Arduino Nano ATmega328, bought at \href{http://nl.rs-online.com/}{rs-components}.
			
			We used a \href{http://www.mijn-gadgets.nl/Webwinkel-Product-157562595/ENC28J60-Ethernet-Shield-Network-Module-V1.0-For-Arduino-Nano.html}{ENC28j60 Ethernet shield}, the version specifically for the nano. This seemed easier than a wifi shield because of this reason, and with a wifi shield it seemed we needed extra components and a circuit, and we didn't really understand it.
		\subsection{External software used}
			We decided on the \href{http://platformio.org/platformio-ide}{PlatformIO IDE}, (which uses python 2.7 and Clang for autocompletion) because it is a lot better than the standard Arduino IDE, and also seemed better than the Stino plugin for Sublime Text 3. A plugin for CLion also looked good but we didn't get that to work. PlatformIO worked when we imported an existing Arduino project, or when we created a new project with only one ino file in the source folder.

		\subsection{Internet/Ethernet connection}
			To connect the Arduino and the Ethernet shield to the internet, we used the \href{https://github.com/jcw/ethercard}{EtherCard} library. Because the ENC28j60 uses a different default CS pin (10 instead of 8), we had to add that in the code when making the connection. This is done by changing
			\begin{lstlisting}
if (ether.begin(sizeof Ethernet::buffer, mymac) == 0) 
			\end{lstlisting}
			(with no pin specified, so the default pin is used) to
			\begin{lstlisting}
if (ether.begin(sizeof Ethernet::buffer, mymac, 10) == 0) 
			\end{lstlisting}
			Note the third argument \lstinline|10| added after \lstinline|mymac|.
